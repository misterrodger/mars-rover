# mars-rover

Implementation of the Mars Rover problem

- Install packages: ```npm i```
- Run tests:  ```npm run test```
- Run code: ```node src/index.js```

Notes:

- The main logic is in marsRover.js.  I used a simple for-loop for the main processing part but this could be done other ways
- In a real-world scenario we could ask if the data input might be adapted to a format native to this particular language and then potentially remove some of the parsing code
